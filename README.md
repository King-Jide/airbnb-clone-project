# airbnb-clone-project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application

## Team Roles
- Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Technology Stack
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design
- Users
  
  - Key Fields:
    -user_id (unique identifier)
    - name
    - email
- Properties
  
  - Important Fields:
    - property_id (unique_identifier)
    - owner_id (foreign key to users)
    - location
  - Relationship:
    Each Property is owned by one User (typically the host). One user can own many properties (One-to-Many).

- Bookings
  
  - Important Fields:
    - booking_id (unique identifier)
    - user_id (who booked - guest)
    - property_id (what's being booked)
      
  - Relationship:
    Each Booking links one User (guest) to one Property. Properties can have many bookings, and users can make many bookings (Many-to-Many, often modeled through this separate entity).

- Payments
  
  - Important Fields:
    - payment_id(unique identifier)
    - booking_id (foreign key to bookings)
    - amount
  - Relationship:
    Each Payment is tied to one Booking. A booking may have one or more payments (e.g., deposit and final payment), depending on your business rules

##  Feature Breakdown
- Main Features:
  - API Documentation
    - OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
    - Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
    - GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
  - User Authentication
    - Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
    - Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
  - Property Management
    - Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
    - Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
  - Booking System
    - Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
    - Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
  - Payment Processing
    - Endpoints: /payments/
    - Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
  -  Review System
    - Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
    - Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
  -  Database Optimizations
      - Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
      - Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.
