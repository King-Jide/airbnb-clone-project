# Airbnb Clone Project

## üß≠ Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a full-scale web application designed to replicate the core features of the Airbnb platform. This project dives into full-stack development with an emphasis on backend architecture, database design, API development, and application security. It provides a hands-on opportunity to understand complex systems, scalable infrastructure, and collaborative development workflows.

## üë• Team Roles
- **Backend Developer**: Builds API endpoints, designs database schemas, and implements business logic.
- **Database Administrator**: Oversees database structure, indexing, and optimization.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Manages deployment pipelines, monitoring, and scalability.
- **QA Engineer**: Conducts thorough testing to ensure backend functionality and stability.

## üß∞ Technology Stack
- **Django**: Python web framework used for backend development.
- **Django REST Framework**: For building and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for structured data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Flexible data querying layer for frontend-backend communication.
- **Celery + Redis**: Used for asynchronous task handling and caching.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments across development and production.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates testing and deployment workflows.

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Design

### Users
- `user_id`, `name`, `email`

### Properties
- `property_id`, `owner_id` (FK to Users), `location`  
**Relationship:** One-to-many ‚Äî a user (host) can own multiple properties.

### Bookings
- `booking_id`, `user_id` (guest), `property_id`  
**Relationship:** Many-to-many ‚Äî users can book multiple properties and each property can have many bookings.

### Payments
- `payment_id`, `booking_id`, `amount`  
**Relationship:** One-to-many ‚Äî a booking can have multiple payment records (e.g., deposit and final payment).

## üöÄ Feature Breakdown

### API Documentation
- Uses **OpenAPI** for standardized documentation.
- **DRF** and **GraphQL** power the API for both structured and flexible queries.

### User Authentication
- **Endpoints**: `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`
- **Features**: User registration, login, profile management.

### Property Management
- **Endpoints**: `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`
- **Features**: CRUD operations for property listings.

### Booking System
- **Endpoints**: `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`
- **Features**: Create, update, and manage bookings with check-in/check-out logic.

### Payment Processing
- **Endpoints**: `/payments/`
- **Features**: Secure handling of transactions linked to bookings.

### Review System
- **Endpoints**: `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`
- **Features**: Submit and manage user reviews for listed properties.

### Database Optimization
- **Indexing**: For fast lookups on frequently queried fields.
- **Caching**: Implemented via Redis to reduce load and boost performance.


## üîê API Security

To ensure the safety and integrity of the application, the following key security measures will be implemented:

### 1. Authentication
Secure login mechanisms (e.g., JWT or OAuth2) will be used to verify user identity before granting access to protected endpoints.  
**Why it's crucial:** Prevents unauthorized access and protects user accounts.

### 2. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will restrict actions based on user roles (e.g., host vs. guest).  
**Why it's crucial:** Ensures users only perform actions they‚Äôre permitted to‚Äîprotects data and system integrity.

### 3. Rate Limiting
Limits the number of requests per user/IP over time using tools like Flask-Limiter or Nginx configs.  
**Why it's crucial:** Prevents abuse, brute-force attacks, and reduces server load.

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
All user input will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).  
**Why it's crucial:** Secures the backend from malicious payloads and ensures data integrity.

### 5. HTTPS Enforcement
All API traffic will be secured via HTTPS.  
**Why it's crucial:** Protects sensitive data (e.g., login credentials) during transmission.


## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment**. It is a development practice that automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes. CI ensures that changes are automatically tested and integrated into the main branch, while CD automates the release of updates to production or staging environments.

### Why It's Important

- **Improves Code Quality:** Automated testing helps catch bugs early in the development cycle.
- **Faster Releases:** Reduces manual steps and accelerates feature delivery.
- **Consistency:** Ensures reliable and repeatable builds and deployments.
- **Collaboration:** Encourages frequent commits and better team workflows.

### Tools We May Use

- **GitHub Actions:** For automating workflows, tests, and deployments.
- **Docker:** For containerizing the application and ensuring consistent environments.
- **Docker Hub:** For storing and sharing Docker images.
- **Heroku / Render / AWS / Azure:** For deploying the application.
- **Linting & Testing Tools:** To enforce code quality and standards.
